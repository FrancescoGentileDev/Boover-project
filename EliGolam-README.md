## My Approach to the project

Me and my team worked together ....

## My Tasks

### Creating and Structuring Database (TEAM)

### WireFrame and Layout

### Inbox CRUD

Simple CRUD imposed by our project assignement. 

Created personal layout to apply the modifications needed without compromising the rest of the team

Created a header component
Created reusable metadata for whole team 

Created MySQL queries in the controller 
User ID to filter inboxes 

Since the user just registered has no Inbox assigned to them we need to add some seeder.
